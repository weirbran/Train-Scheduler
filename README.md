# Train-Scheduler

### Overview

This is the seventh assignment for the Coding Bootcamp delivereed at University of Toronto Mississauga.

In this assignment we were required to create a train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. The app retrieves and manipulates this information with Moment.js. It also provides up-to-the-minute information about various trains, namely their arrival times, and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station.

### Description

The user acts as an administrator and submits a train to the schedule with the following information: train name, destination, first train time (in military time), and the frequency (in minutes). The app calculates how many minutes it will take for the next train to arrive relative to the current time and displays the arrival time. The page refreshes every minute to display updated information.
